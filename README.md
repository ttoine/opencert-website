# OpenCERT website
A place to build a website for OpenCERT Eclipse project

## Structure
When you use Hugo, static html website is generated in the /public folder. Here on Github, we need those files to be in the "gh-pages" branch.

So, if you need the files to run the Hugo website locally and modify it, clone this repo, do your changes on "master", generate the website with Hugo. Then push. Git should send the files in "gh-pages".

Don't forget to change the site url in the config file.
