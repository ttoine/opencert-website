title: Documentation

This is where you can write your documentation if you want to do it with Hugo, in markdown. You can then put all the  screenshots, graphics and other pictures in the "static" folder. There is already a "help" folder too.

Or, you can use a dedicated application to write your documentation, and export it in static HTML. You can then put it in this folder, it will be available when you upload your website on the webserver. Do not forget to update the link on the [Documentation](../documentation) page.
