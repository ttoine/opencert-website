Think about this page as the place to write all the important information about the project. Here are a few ideas that will help your end users and contributors. Don't forget to remove this paragraph before publishing the website. You can of course create your help with Hugo, in markdown, or use a dedicated application, export it and put it in this website.

You can also add an "Archive" section for documentation about older versions.
